# Quarto Template for UniMa

This is a quarto template to use for people from the University of Mannheim.
It is inspired by [quarto-metropolis](https://codeberg.org/pat-s/quarto-metropolis/src/branch/main) and [mzes-beamer-metropolis](https://github.com/denis-cohen/mzes-beamer-metropolis).
Feel free to check them out and edit/fork the theme as you like.
This is work in progress.

## Installing

Go to the folder you want to have your presentation in and execute this command.

```bash

quarto use template git@github.com:FriederRodewald/quarto_theme_unima.git

```

This will install the extension and create `template.qmd` that you can use as a starting place for your presentation.

## Format Options

I applied some basic formatting in the `unima.scss` file.
The basic functionality is spelled out in the `template.qmd`.

## Example

At a later stage, I will include example screenshots here.
